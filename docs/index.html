                                    mounted to/on/in (whether assembled or not). Stand-alone or extra PCBs are counted

                                    switches and keycaps are not counted in their respective categories.</dd>

                                    sufficient to fill a board (excluding macropads and number pads) to count.
                                    Duplicate sets are counted if they were purchased separately or are used/intended
                                    to be used on separate boards.</dd>

                                    Modified switch sets include those that you have lubed, filmed, or made other
                                    similar modifications to. Clipping switch pins does not count as a modification. If
                                    you make Frankenswitches (where you take components from one set of switches and use
                                    them to replace the components of another set of switches) both sets are considered
                                    modified if both sets have been reassembled. Each set of modified switches is
                                    counted as a single set regardless of the number of modifications made.</dd>

                                <dd>The total number of keycaps sets you own. If you have multiple kits for the same set
                                    they are all counted as one set unless they can be used to fully kit multiple boards
                                    in which case they are counted as a number of sets equal to the number of boards
                                    they can fully kit simultaneously. Artisan Keycaps are counted as Accessories.</dd>

                                <dd>The Hurley Score is a formula created by members of the #keyboards channel of the
                                    Relay.fm members' discord. It's intended to be a standardized measure of the size of
                                    your  keyboard collection and how far down the keyboard rabbit hole you've gone.
                                </dd>

                                <dt>What about "non-mechanical" keyboards?</dt>
                                <dd>Follow your heart. Some members of the community count them, others do not. If you
                                    do count them each board counts as 1 keyboard, 1 unmodified switch set, and 1 keycap
                                    set.</dd>

                                <dt>What about tools and suplies (like brushes, lube, silicon, foam, etc.)?</dt>
                                <dd>We, your humble Keyboard Sherpas, don't generally count these kinds of things. But
                                    follow your heart.</dd>

                                <dt>Why is the count divided by 3?</dt>
                                <dd>There are a few reasons: 1) it makes the resulting score more manageable. 2) It
                                    makes the outcome more intuitive. A complete keyboard (board + switches + keycaps)
                                    gets a score of 1.</dd>

                                <dt>Why is this a thing?</dt>
                                <dd>Because keyboards are cool! Next question.</dd>

                                <dt>How do I stop?</dt>
                                <dd>If we figure it out, we'll let you know. In the meantime join our support/enablers
                                    group at Relay.fm/membership.</dd>

                                <dt>What is Myke's Hurley Score?</dt>

                                <dd>As of 2021-04-26T15:10:00Z, the ratio of Myke's Hurley Score to the Hackett
